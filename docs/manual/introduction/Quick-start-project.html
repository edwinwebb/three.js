		<p>
			This project is designed to get you started with three.js development using modern tools.
		</p>
		<p>
			Included in the project is code for a Camera, Scene and Renderer. It's also easy to manage 
			file imports and has examples to copy.
		</p>
			You will need some basic experience with terminal and will need to install Node.js to 
			access the Node Package Manager. These are common tools for the modern javascript developer 
			and are well worth learning.
		</p>
		<p>
			Follow the instructions at
			[link:https://github.com/edwinwebb/three-seed/]
			to get started.
