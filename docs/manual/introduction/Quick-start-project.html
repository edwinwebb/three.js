			The <a href="https://github.com/edwinwebb/three-seed/">three-seed</a> project is designed 
			to get you started with three.js development using modern tools. Use it to quickly get 
			going on your next three.js project or a easy environment to start playing with the 
			library. 
		</p>
		<h2>What's included</h2>
		<p>
			Included in the project is code for a Camera, Scene and Renderer. It's also easy to manage 
			file imports and has examples of loading models and updating the scene. The project will 
			also set up a local development server which automatically updates the browser.
		</p>
		<h2>Getting started</h2>

			You will need some basic experience with terminal and will need to install Node.js to 
			access the Node Package Manager. These are common tools for the modern javascript developer 
			and are well worth learning.
